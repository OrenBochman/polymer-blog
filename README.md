polymer-blog
============

A tutorial application built to demonstrate how to use `generator-polymer` with Yeoman. The blog is basically a one-page SPA using the Google Docs Spreadsheet API as a data-source, custom Polymer elements and the existing JSONP, Gravatar and Flatiron Polymer elements to give us things like routing and profile pictures.
